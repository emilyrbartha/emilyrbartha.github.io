I recently came across [this](http://blog.hackerrank.com/the-risky-eclipse-of-statisticians/) article from the tech blog HackerRank, bemoaning the absence of statisticians in the Big Data revolution. This is not a new topic in the statistics online circles, and it has been the subject of many articles in the last few years. It is something I think about often as someone in the early stages of my career, especially since I am most interested in the more programming-heavy and computational side of statistics.

Here are some examples of other blogs on the subject: 

- [Why Big Data is is Trouble: They Forgot About Applied Statistics](http://simplystatistics.org/2014/05/07/why-big-data-is-in-trouble-they-forgot-about-applied-statistics/)
- [Did Big Data Kill the Statistician?](http://www.statslife.org.uk/opinion/1955-did-big-data-kill-the-statistician)
- [Data Science: The End of Statistics?](https://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/2013/04/13/data-science-the-end-of-statistics/)

I won't rehash the whole issue (if you are unfamiliar the links above are a good resource), but I will say I do not disagree with these articles in essence. Here are some notable snippets:

>When physicists do mathematics, they don’t say they’re doing “number science”. They’re doing math. If you’re analyzing data, you’re doing statistics. You can call it data science or informatics or analytics or whatever, but it’s still statistics. [[4]](https://normaldeviate.wordpress.com/2013/04/13/data-science-the-end-of-statistics/)

>Instead of crowning statisticians king, the Big Data revolution borrowed the foundational elements of applied statistics, married it with computer science and birthed an entirely new heir: The Data Scientist. But this underrepresentation of statisticians puts the future of Big Data at risk. [[1]](http://blog.hackerrank.com/the-risky-eclipse-of-statisticians/)

>The other ‘big’ problem is in how so many people are willing to jump on the flimflam trend wagon in order to wing their way into a ‘data scientist’ niche. Or rebrand themselves as data scientists as a reaction to the IT industry’s crude ‘downgrading’ of the role of statistician - quite often backed by a long concatenation of meaningless clichés, logical fallacies, inaccuracies and blatant misrepresentation. Using the past to predict or shape the future is nothing new, so why do people pretend that it is new? [[3]](http://www.statslife.org.uk/opinion/1955-did-big-data-kill-the-statistician)

You can see from the above that many statisticians are disgruntled with the positioning of data science as a new field that is different and more valuable than stale, archaic statistics.

And I agree with them, sort of.

Doing data science without an infusion of sound statistical knowledge is dangerous and not likely to produce good results (see the [Google Flu](http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/03/28/google-flu-trends-the-limits-of-big-data/) controvery, for example). Having more data cannot solve all of your problems absent the skills and knowledge to wield it. Black box machine learning algorithms, while useful and powerful, cannot tell the complete story. We need intuition, visualization, and solid statistical thinking as badly as we need programming and Big Data processing skills.

But we as statisticians need to stop whining about our exclusion and learn how to adapt. Conflating the need for people with solid analytical expertise and training with the need for statisticians to rule the roost is a mistake. Perhaps the fact that tech and business leaders are referring to something that is so clearly statistics by a bunch of other names is a sign that statisticians have a branding problem, that the prophecy by Google chief economist Hal Valarian that "the next sexy job of the next 10 years will be statisticians" is not coming true. HackerRank identifies three reasons why statisticians aren't leading the Big Data revolution:

>First, computational statistics of Big Data never flourished in mainstream statistical sciences. Second, statistics is a crucial part of data science, but it alone is insufficient in making sense of exponential amounts of messy data we are producing daily. Third, some statisticians simply have no interest in carrying out scientific methods for business-oriented data science. [[1]](http://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/07/opinion/eight-no-nine-problems-with-big-data.html?_r=0)

It is clear that data science is not going to align itself with statistics anytime soon, but statisticians can still have an impact by aligning themselves with data science. I think it is very important for statisticians as a whole and more specifically those early in their industry career (like myself) to be proactive in changing the image of our field and getting the jobs we want.

Here are some alternative ways that we can respond: 

### Modernize Statistics Education

I recently graduated from a fairly well respected statistics graduate program, whose students go on to be successful in industry and academia alike. In my time in grad school, I not once had to analyze a dataset larger than 1000 rows, never queried a database, and never scraped web data or text mined tweets. Most of our time was spent knee deep in theory: we did proofs, read textbooks, and took written tests. 

I definitely don't mean to denigrate the importance of a solid theoretical foundation, as I believe that my program prepared me extremely well with the tools to think like a statistician. And I understand their approach, after all, the majority of my professors have been in academia their whole lives and do all they can to prepare their students for a similar path. But the reality is that nearly all students with an MS, and over half of students with a PhD end up working in industry. 

Many graduates of traditional statistics graduate programs end up picking up these computational skills on their own through personal projects, research assistantships or on the job, but wouldn't it be better if computational skills (i.e. programming tools such as Python and Hadoop) as well as machine learning concepts were integrated into the curriculm? Maybe not for all students, but at least available as an option for those who are interested in a data science career. I know that some universities have already started to do this (JHU Biostatistics comes to mind), and I hope others will follow suit. I am lucky that my MS in statistics has proved valuable in my career and I think it is important that a formal education in statistics continues to be an asset in the tech field.

### Choose Your Employer Carefully

As the job title has become more and more popular, the confusion over what makes a "data scientist" and what companies look for has intensified. It can be frustrating to search for a job believing that you are perfectly suited for a career as a data scientist, and yet find that many companies don't value your skills. Even more frustrating is the fact that some require a set of skills that are extremely rare to find in one person, a [unicorn](http://www.informationweek.com/big-data/big-data-analytics/are-you-recruiting-a-data-scientist-or-unicorn/d/d-id/899843) of sorts. Along these same lines, I recently stumbled upon a job posting for a "Big Data Specialist" that stated explicitly that the candidate needed to possess "knowledge of nearly everything".

For those of us working in the technology, finance, etc. industries where data scientists typically reside, rest assured: we don't need to be unicorns. The onus is on you to develop the skills and experience to attract the *right* company, but it is unimportant and probably not even possible to satisfy the requirements for every "data scientist" position out there. Not everyone thinks that statisticians make the best data scientists, but those that value statistical thinking and even better, include statisticians among people from different disciplines in their data science teams, will be the most successful. And it is in these types of teams and companies that statisticians who are aspiring data scientists will be able to contribute the most to. 

A pragmatic solution for those job searching in industry is to focus on employers that value your skills and give you an opportunity to do interesting work. I know that finding that special company or employer is easier said than done, but we are lucky that people with a statistics background are still quite in-demand and have many options in the job market. Patience and effort in finding your best fit will pay off in the long run far more than trying to appeal to every company in the data science world.

### Don't Pick Teams

I happily refer to myself as a statistician **AND** a data scientist, and I will continue to take on any label if it means doing cool and meaningful work. There is nothing to argue about if we stop identifying ourselves as different from others who are are essentially doing the same thing: using data to tell stories and solve problems.

In conclusion, I think it is time for statisticians to adapt their thinking, because the explosion of technology and computing capabilities is not going to stop changing our industry. There are things we can do as individuals: for example, I'm currently working on learning Python, taking a Coursera course on machine learning, and hopefully continuing to contribute ideas and personal projects to this blog. But I think the real change needs to be a cultural one, coming from statisticians as a whole. I would argue that there has already been significant progress made towards this goal, and it may get easier to assess the state of our field in the next few years as the hype over Big Data dies down a little.

I plan to blog some more about this topic in the coming months, hopefully including some input from other people who work in the data science field
as well as an analysis of the difference between job postings for statisticians vs. data scientists on popular job searching websites. So stay tuned!
